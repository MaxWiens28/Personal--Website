      <h1>ME</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Hi! I'm Max, a inspiring software and game developer from Canada, I've been interested in making games my whole life, so I decided to turn that interest into a career. In 2022 I graduated from Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology (MITT) studying Full Stack Software Development.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Below you can view some of the projects I've had the opportunity of working on. Along with some of my personal projects. I have a strong perseverance for learning new things and taking on challenges. I consistently enjoy putting extra time in it polishing my creations, to make sure the vision is achieved in the best possible way. I've always been extremely curious in the technical side of games, and sometimes this curiosity has led me to create some of the projects shown below</p>
      <br>
      <p>ENJOY !</p>
